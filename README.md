# React--Series


A simple repo to track my React learning journey, lecture by lecture.

##  Whatâ€™s inside?

Each folder contains code from individual React lectures:

- `Lecture1` â€“ JSX & Functional Components
- `Lecture2` â€“ Props & Component Reuse
- `Lecture3` â€“ Event Handling
- `Lecture4` â€“ More Practice
- `Lecture5` â€“ ...
- and so on...

##  Why this repo?

To keep my learning consistent and public â€” 1 lecture, 1 folder, 1 step closer to becoming a solid React developer.
